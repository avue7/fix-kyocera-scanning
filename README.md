# Fix Kyocera Scanning
This is a PowerShell script that was created and used by me to help speed up the process in setting up a Kyocera printer's scanning option to a local Windows PC or workstation. This script may also be use to help setup SMB scanning options for other printers as well. The beauty of this script is that you can always use it to help troubleshoot or "RESET" the correct settings to allow for SMB scanning (ver. 2+), after you have setup a successful connection at the client side. 

<b>Please note:</b> this script assumes that SMB ver. 2+ is not disabled. This will only work for SMB version 1 if you have enabled it on the client's computer. Kyocera printers with 0 series requires you to manually enable SMB version 1, if not already, as it comes with Windows disabled. 

## Reasons For Creating This Script
1. <b>Unity</b>: Ensures my colleague and I know exactly where to troubleshoot in case script fails or errors out.  
2. <b>Redundancy</b>: I do this on a normal basis at work. It makes sense to automate possible-scripting tasks to a machine.   
3. <b>Productivity</b>: The script is small in file size but can do the majority of the heavy lifting on a client's computer. It can be transferred to the client's computer within seconds. This especially helps while on remote with clients.  While on remote, depending on latency and how fast the client's computer is, I can normally setup the client's computer for scanning from the Kyocera printer within 5-15 minutes. This script can do it within seconds. This script will be your friend especially on really slow internet connection or slow computers while on remote. This was one of my biggest motivation for creating the script in the first place. 
4. <b>Efficiency</b>: This script eliminates human error during setup and while running it to troubleshoot and fix scanning at the client's computer or workstation. 
5. <b>Ease of Use</b>: This was another big motivation for me. Most of my clients cannot perform their duties without their Kyocera printer. Thus, if there is an issue with scanning, it would cause a delay for them. Some of them have asked me if there was an easier way for them to troubleshoot their own problems without having to contact us or wait for us to fix it for them. This script was created with the intention of the customer being able to simply double-click this file, run it, and the script will automatically set the correct settings for them to presume scanning. With Windows update and the clients dynamic setting of their network settings, coming in and out of the office, clients may not be aware or may forget to set or reset an option to the correct setting for scanning (SMB) to work.
